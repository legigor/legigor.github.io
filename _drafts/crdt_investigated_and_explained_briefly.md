# CRDT: investigated and explained briefly

'It will be just a Cargo Shipment Control application' - they said. 'Just need to decide this class its an entity or an value object' they said. But one day we found us digged into all this CAP stuff fighing for consistency of events streams, reading about Actor Model, Vector Clock and CRDT. Damn, I miss the days I could play with my little ships.
