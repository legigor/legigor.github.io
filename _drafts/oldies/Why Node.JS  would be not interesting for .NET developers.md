# Why Node.js would be not interesting for .NET developers

The main reference here is to the Mike's irony post about Node.NET implementation.

Low interest from the .NET comunity here is because:
- Node.JS contains nothing new from the general technology approaches
- All fun with Node.JS is in application lifecycle: development and deployemnt
- Yes, it would be alos interesting as a general-purpose server platform (not only a HTTP-server)
- In the .NET world we already have all these technologies, so, we just need to cover the benefints of Node.JS like lifecycle
- It's good to compare XMPP servers implementations over Node.JS and existing .NET stack witch comparable designs
- SignalR - does it cover something similar to Node.JS?
